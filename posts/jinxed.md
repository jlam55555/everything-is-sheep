[I was *right*][1]. Too right. And now I'm crying inside.

It's the worst feeling to know you've let someone down, and I did. Again. Today.

We played the first place team, Fairfield High, today. And while they were undefeated, there was still a good chance that we would win at least one game. We were the only team that had the potential to beat them at all.

The first game didn't go too well. One of them started with a seven-bagger, and two with a six-bagger. I think that's never happened in the history of the league. We lost roughly 850 to 1050.

The second game wasn't great either. I bowled a 148, which is not amazing, but our team finished 150 pins below Fairfield, so I don't particularly blame myself. 

The last game is what bothers me. I spent the majority of the second game trying to adjust and find a good line that would suit me. I thought I had found it by the end of the second game, but I only realized a better line by the third frame of the third game. Unfortunately, that meant I left two open frames at the start of the third game. And while I had a clean game after that, we lost.

It came down to the last frame.

Erik bowled, as usual, impeccably. Two nine-spares and the rest strikes. He finished with a six-bagger and a 269. And the rest of the team performed well. But it came down to Mike from Fairfield and I. I had a turkey behind me, and Mike had a spare. If I struck out, we would win.

I didn't strike out. I trembled from the nervousness and got an eight-spare, and then a strike. From that, we were thirty-nine points ahead. If Mike struck out, we would lose.

We lost.

Alex blames himself, but I blame myself more than anyone. I've been the one bowling for six years. I completely missed a 3-6-10 spare in the second frame of that game. That doesn't warrant forgiveness. I'm the anchor. I'm supposed to know how to handle situations like that well. But I failed, and our team sunk with me. RIP.

I knew this was coming yesterday. And, just like the poor Titanic, I didn't do anything.
