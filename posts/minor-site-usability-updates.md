<p>I know I just said that I wouldn't be making updates to the site, but it's a Saturday and I have time. There were a few minor details I wanted to fix to improve the site, like always. Here's an overview:<ul><li><strong>FontAwesome Icons</strong> I've replaced some of the minor images to <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome icons</a>. As I've mentioned earlier, it's <a href="http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=25">pretty amazing</a>: it's clean, it's versatile, and it acts like dynamic, style-able regular text.</li><li><strong>Improved Post Listing</strong> I've added the date and author of the posts for clarity in the About section.</li><li><strong>Fixed Dark Gradients</strong> In Safari (for iOS), the gradients from transparent to white were too dark. This has been fixed.</li><li><strong>Stopped Syntax Highlighting</strong> I felt that the extra time spent loading the scripts for syntax highlighting were unnecessary, even despite its awesomeness. I figured you all don't care about code that much anyways. In addition, there haven't been many posts with code (only two)&mdash; the code will still be formatted with indenting monospaced text, but it will not be colored anymore.</li></ul></p><p>Also, this is the fiftieth post! I'm surprised I survived this far!</p>
