<p>Although I really should be studying for <a href="https://fcml.wikispaces.com/">math team</a> and the <a href="http://www.maa.org/math-competitions">AMC</a>, I decided to spend a little more time programming today. I created something I've wanted to for some time: a little <a href="extras/Agenda"><strong>Agenda</strong></a>.</p><p>It's a cool little device that allows you to add classes and assignments (with optional descriptions) onto the site. For now, it's mainly for demonstrative purposes and nothing gets saved, but you can download your agenda in a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON format</a> for now. <strike>I'll add a feature in the near future</strike> <strong>EDIT</strong> I've just added a feature in which you can actually use that JSON to repopulate the program.</p><p>At the moment, it's the bare minimum of a program. However, it uses many exciting web technologies I've learned, many of them recently. This includes the idea of JavaScript objects (and JSON), <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> (the first time I've used it with jQuery), <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions">CSS transitions</a>, downloadable content, uploadable content (coming soon), and such a nice, clean interface. It's modeled a bit after the modern feel of <a href="https://www.google.com/keep/">Google Keep</a> (which I also use regularly because of Google's awesomeness), but much simpler and aimed towards homework.</p><p>This idea was supposed to be one component aspect of my grand vision of "<em>Stutor</em>": a study platform designed for <em>students</em> to teach other students. I've made a few attempts over the years to create the entire program, but the daunting aspect of an unfinishable platform always stopped me a few days in. I've occasionally built little parts that I've envisioned to be part of it&mdash; the most notable of which are this agenda and the <a href="extras/Chat">chat</a>&mdash; but I've never really got to it. It's still a cool idea that is forming in my brain, however. I can't simplify it enough in a way that makes it seem manageable, so I haven't gotten to it yet.</p><p>But I will. I think I will&hellip;</p>
