<p>I made a few quick changes to improve the overall display of the website.</p><p>First of all, the date <strong>will not</strong> change if I edit a post. Therefore, the posts will appear in chronological order, and this will avoid confusion when I do edit a post. I will indicate when I update a post directly in the update instead. (I will update the previous update on updating posts to make sure that this will work).</p><p>Secondly, all <code style="font-family:courier">&lt;a&gt;</code> (link), <code style="font-family:courier">&lt;em&gt;</code> (italics), and <code style="font-family:courier">&lt;strong&gt;</code> (bold) tags appear <em>inline</em> and with their parent's <em>font-size</em> and <em>color</em>. This will avoid some inconsistencies in the font that appeared earlier. Long links also were problematic in the mobile version, and this will fix that as well.</p><p>Also, as a precaution, I will be backing up the site posts. It won't affect you, but it's for my peace-of-mind.</p>
