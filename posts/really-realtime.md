<img class="half postImageRight" src="http://blog.ijasoneverett.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/nodejs_logo.png" /><p>I was experimenting around with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, a powerful JavaScript library that I had little understanding of. This was because I had heard it had certain <a href="http://www.websocket.org/">websocket</a> back-end capabilities that I had wanted for real-time data updates. In this, the server (the back-end) can send data <em>back to</em> the client (the front-end, or browser), which is a powerful tool that I've never encountered.</p><p>So I played around with it a little bit, and I eventually made a little real-time chat program with <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>, which builds a websocket server-side. See my demo at <strong><a href="https://lam-node-test.herokuapp.com/">Realtime Chatting</a></strong>.</p>
