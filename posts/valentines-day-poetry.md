For journaling class, on Valentine's Day. Sorry this is a day late.

Inspired by ["Your 13-Word Love Stories"][1]. They're about love, if love includes disgust.

> "Puppy Love": Kissing, hugging, hand in hand. Blocking dozens of students from getting to class.

Inspired by [*Heating and Cooling: 52 Micro Memoirs*][2].

> "Chinese Love": I guess my parents told them we drink a lot of milk at home. They didn't drink milk, and didn't have any at their house. So the first day at work, her husband dragged me to the grocery store next to her store and ordered me to get a milk carton. I couldn't refuse&mdash; physically. So we got a half-gallon of Lactaid milk (there was no regular alternative) and left. We did not get close to finishing the half-gallon by the time we left their house a week later.
