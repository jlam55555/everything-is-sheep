<p><h3>Coding</h3></p><ul><li>I've got another one. Based off of <a href="http://jacobwunder.com/">Jacob Wunder</a>'s <a href="http://jacobwunder.com/tap-tap-pop/">Tap Tap Pop!</a> (which was based off of <a href="http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2015/10/02/simple-machine-brings-pop-the-lock-to-android/">Pop the Lock</a>), <a href="extras/PopTheLock"><strong>here</strong></a> is my own version of Pop the Lock. It's arguably very simple, minimalistic, and feature-less&mdash; but it captures the main essence of the game<span class="footnoteId">1</span>.</li><li>I'm getting along farther with <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> now. I've completed 62 problems (up to question 97), and they are really a <em>fun</em> challenge in the world of the <em>dull</em> challenges of school. Feel free to check out my solutions at <a href="extras/Euler">my Euler page</a>.</li><li>The new programming club at Barlow<span class="footnoteId">2</span> is moving along smoothly. Many of the others are learning game development, especially through JS and its libraries. I've worked on <a href="http://barlowprogramming.github.io/">a fun little website</a> with it, which uses many new technologies. I've worked with others (essentially) for the first time, and learned some more of the GitHub workflow. I've even got some people to try Project Euler with me! Us nerds are busy learning and coding. Cheers!</li></ul><p><hr /></p><p><h3>School</h3></p><ul><li>Ah, school. I'm finally beginning to get into the swing of things in this crazy second semester. A quarter has just passed, many assessments finished, and now I can clean out much of my binder.</li><li>Sophomore speakouts are coming up soon! I really need to organize myself and strengthen my topic. As I've <a href="http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=66">mentioned earlier</a>, I'll try to use these blog posts as thinking on paper.</li></ul><p><hr /></p><p><h3>Extracurriculars</h3></p><ul><li>School bowling season has finished. I need to find new recruits for my captain-hood next year. Regular bowling is as normal.</li><li>Track season has started! I'm injured. &#9785;</li><li>I've had quite an interesting experience with piano. I played terribly at the YMF, completely starting over because of a memory error. I somehow managed to get a (full) 5 score on it, however. Today, with the same piece, I managed to tie for first in a Chopin competition. I was not expecting it, and now I have to play it again next week. I'm not enthused. That means another week of hard practice, another week of stressing out, another week of time management battles, another week of multiple piano lessons. But on the upside, it means $50 in prize money<span class="footnoteId">3</span>!</li></ul><p class="footnoteContainer"><span class="footnoteId footnote" data-ref="1">1: I believe, as I have not not played the original game.</span></p><p class="footnoteContainer"><span class="footnoteId footnote" data-ref="2">2: Check out <a href="https://github.com/BarlowProgramming/">our GitHub</a>.</span></p><p class="footnoteContainer"><span class="footnoteId footnote" data-ref="3">3: It is not actually that much considering that the entry fee was $45.</span></p>
