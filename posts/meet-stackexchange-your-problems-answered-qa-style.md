![StackExchange sites][1]

This is my first post tagged "Great." I truly believe in its powers and recommend it to all of the readers out there.

What I'm referencing is the Q&A monopoly network [StackExchange][3]. It's a great community effort of many millions of people. It's a community-based site — you can build up reputation to unlock more privileges as you use the site more, so that their experience allows for more. In addition, creating an account is **FREE**, and you can have one account (and one sign-in) throughout all of the 150 different StackExchange sites.

I primarily use it for programming on StackExchange's largest and oldest site, [StackOverflow][5] (here's my [profile][6]), a site with eleven million questions and five million users! Simply put, it's a pleasure helping others on the site with their programming problems and seeing my own being answered with amazing speed (usually within ten minutes of my asking) and kindness (yes, anonymous posters on Internet communities are generally nice) and intelligence (some of the algorithms are simply brilliant) and expertise (many of the users are professional programmers). And earning reputation is fun too ☺.
