I wanted to start a dream journal, because it just seemed like a fun thing to keep track of. Here's an update from last night:

&mdash;

As with all dreams, the highest resolution comes when you wake up, at the very end of the dream.

So I woke up, and I couldn't really breathe. Really. It wasn't that I was hyperventilating, or that I was scared. It was a strange leftover pain from last night in my chest. I think it was dust from cleaning the house or grease and other chemicals from the garage, but I'm not sure.

I was running right before I woke up. Running to the top of a mountain. It was a rest stop, and we had before 8:00p.m., when my photography team and I would have a photo shoot. It was around 6:00p.m. at that moment.

We (I'm not sure who was with me, but I remember a group of ten to twenty people) had just been filming some sort of mock fighting scene. Imagine an ancient Roman infantry charge, scaled down to a dozen people. There were a few takes, and eventually we called it a day. Nothing too intensive.

I remember driving there. The surrounding area was something suburban, with idyllic green grass on the road dividers and on the sides. On the drive I remember pulling into a short dead-end street&mdash; no sidewalk, no houses, and you could see the end; just asphalt replacing a length of grass&mdash; and practicing parallel parking like I have been doing, repeatedly on the curb. I pulled out and left to the filming scene when other cars pulled into the same street, presumably also to practice parking.

&mdash;

That's all I remember. It's funny that, although I was shaken awake by my dad, there was no climax at the moment of awakening like there usually is. But there was that continuity into real life&mdash; the chest pain&mdash; that brought this dream to life. And then there's the setup&mdash; the driving and the fight scene and the hill&mdash; as if my mind is conjuring up some extremely long-winded explanation for the pain. I wish we understood dreams better from any perspective, scientific or otherwise.

So if anyone asks, I got my chest pain from a battle charge I led against Julius Caesar in 62 B.C. And if they ask why it still hurts, some two millenia later, it's because we were defeated. End of story.
