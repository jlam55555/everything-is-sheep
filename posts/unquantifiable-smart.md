There's no easy way to determine intelligence, or how "smart" someone really is. No superb test scores, academic achievements, nor learning ability can be a sure-fire method of determining level of smartness.

Sure, there's IQ tests and other specific, scientific measurements that may be very close to ["your fluid and crystallized intelligence"][1], or your reasoning skills. But, according to CNN, there are [many other aspects that it leaves out][2].

    We see what the kid looks like on this day, on this particular test, with this particular tester. Van Gemert

This quote is not only true of special tests such as the IQ test, but every other test: on the average school day (and despite the teachers' urging), students openly spread the news that a certain grade has been posted, flood PowerSchool, and go around reciting their grades and comparing themselves to others. "Oh, you're so smart!" they might remark to others; or, in a more mocking manner, "Ha, you're stupid".

This is a major pet peeve of mine. What does that insignificant little double-digit (or triple-digit, if you're a good student) percentage mean in the grand scheme of life? Even if it were an accurate determining factor, how would one puny grade make or break your a whole academic career? And because some classes are more difficult than others, and some subjects more frightening to those of a certain personality, and some types of tests and exam questions appeal to a certain student more, and some professors that have a teacher's pet (that isn't you) — yes, it's understandable that things differ from person to person. In addition, the very skill of test-taking may be a particular, singular strength of a person, making the impressive only in grades (which falsely impresses upon other students). There's always that occasional nerd out there who preys on extra credit and every opportunity to study in order to get a good grade and lose their life as a result.

It's so frustrating to know that so many people watch their grades so closely. Yes, doing well in school is important; but it's not about every little detail! It's actually quite hypocritical of me to write all of this because of the perfectionist I am at heart, but I do truly believe it.

If I was unclear, there are two major themes meddling around here — that no single grade is the end of the world (nor perhaps the beginning); and that, because as Gemert said, circumstances change, and the typical single mark (the kind that we high-schoolers stress about every day of our entire four-year career) doesn't really mean too much. So lighten up!
