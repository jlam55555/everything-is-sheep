<p>The result of my <a href="http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=27">preliminary experimentation</a> with Node.js and Socket.io has resulted in an interesting, real-time chat application!</p><p>You can visit it either at <a href="https://lam-node-test.herokuapp.com" style="font-family:courier">lam-node-test.herokuapp.com</a></code> where it's hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or here at <strong><a href="http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/extras/Chat" style="font-family: courier">TheHomeworkLife</a></strong>. They both push messages towards the same server, so if you see messages on either application, it'll show up on both! It's still in real-time, and now uses FontAwesome icons <a href="http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf/index.html?post=25">that I was experimenting with before</a>.</p><p>Note that there may be a few-second delay (a warming-up of the Node.js server) when first visiting the site for the first time. This is the result of my free hosting. It should start quickly in subsequent runs.</p>
