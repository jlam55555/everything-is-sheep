This won't be long, because I don't remember much.

We were at a bowling lane. "We" this time refers to our grade at school&mdash; I specifically remembered a Kyle, a Rachel, and a Sam from our school, and I know that I recognized some other faces. 

The format was the bowling wasn't quite right&mdash; it was like the "XTreme" bowling at the local bowling center, but it was too dark and the colorful lights were too harsh. There was a lot of me walking behind the lanes, watching others bowl. I don't remember if I actually bowled at all.

Before long, we were herded into a large room off to the left at the end of the main hallway in the bowling center, which was lit in a similar, dark fashion. The seats were set up as if we were at a band concert at school. I was in the front row. I remember Kyle walking by in front, and I called out to him. I don't remember if there was any sort of presentation happening in front of us, but I do remember getting drowsy and dozing off before my classmates jolted me awake.

I don't think that this was the very end of the dream, but it was near the end. It was all too surreal, what with all of the neon colors in the darkness.

It's funny that as I write, the dream fades so quickly. It's as if the memory was a Snapchat post&mdash; one view only, and then *poof*!
