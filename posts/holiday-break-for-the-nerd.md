It's easy to equate the screams of cheer and the candies and general joyfulness in school to the merriness of Christmas and winter break. But is break overrated?

Christmas break is the first break longer than four days (Thanksgiving break) in the school year, and it occurs only a week and a half before midterm exams start. To us high schoolers, it means a time to relax and get away from high school drama and avoid homework.

The teachers this year (but not next year, according to my sis' the junior) offered little written homework, much to the delight of other students. Many of them actually said that they didn't need us to spend any time doing homework, save a *little* review.

But what they really meant is that we should use the time born from the lack of homework to time for studying.

In English, an analytical paper (although not strictly in the traditional sense) and an "annotated bib(liography)" is due and a study guide was given to us; in algebra and chemistry, a study guide was handed out; but, other than that, there was little homework in the traditional sense. And to many students, that screams *FREE* in their faces.

But what about me? I despise being idle. I'm either coding, doing HW, studying, bowling, running, in school, in a car, sleeping, eating, or hopelessly idle. So I think I'll study over break. Teachers, stop being so cryptic!
