<p><em>The Homework Life</em> is one step closer to becoming a more widely supported blog with <strong>RSS feeds</strong>! Now, you can subscribe to <a href="feed.xml">the feed</a> by simply giving the link to a feed reader, such as <a href="http://feedreader.com/">FeedReader</a>. It allows you to easily see the ten most recent posts without having to regularly check the site, and from a feedreader in which you can check all your favorite other blogs and news sources.</p><p><em>The Homework Life</em> has also returned to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> at <a href="https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life">jlam55555/the-homework-life</a>. The full code is there, and I'll be committing to it with any updates I make. It only includes the main site, however&mdash; other, side projects are hosted in their own repositories.</p><p>Another fancy improvement to the site will be the increasing usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG images</a>. This post image, for example, is one. SVGs have the power to <em>infinitely</em> scale&mdash; no zooming will decrease its resolution, unlike most other image formats, which are <em>raster</em> images rather than <em>vector</em> graphics. Try it on the post image, for example: open it on a new tab and zoom! They are defined based on <em>shapes</em>, not <em>pixels</em>, and they are written in plain XML (simple text). Now, although it is still a non-standard web technology, it has <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg">widespread support</a> amongst all the major browsers. I've been using <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> to create them, and I'd highly recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here are some other examples of fun SVGs to create. The cow was created from a <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/17676/cartoon-cow">PNG image</a>, and the tree was created from a <a href="http://c85c7a.medialib.glogster.com/media/38/38f41db110cb7f0978670f05af2a42d443ae63204aca54703ac1baa2e795a97d/tree-in-meadow.jpg">JPG image</a> that was manipulated with Inkscape's Vonoroi Diagram Delaunay Triangulation to create a <a href="http://goinkscape.com/low-poly-art-tutorial-using-inkscape/">"low polygonal art" effect</a>. Again, look at their actual sizes (50px by 50px and 40px by 40px, respectively) to see that they really do scale.</p><img class="postImageLeft" style="width:calc(50% - 40px)" src="/images/posts/cow.svg" /><img class="postImageLeft" style="width:calc(50% - 40px)" src="images/posts/tree.svg" />
