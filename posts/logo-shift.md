You may wonder why the logo has changed from the sheep (which may be more representative of the title) to the simpler, (potentially "uglier"), six-rectangle square.

![Logo Shift][1]

The reason is akin to Google's [changing of their logo in 2015][2]. While their old logo, which had been fundamentally unchanged since 1999, had more texture, it wasn't quite *modern*. It had become a landmark, but it had fallen behind with the times. While major tech contenders such as Apple and Logo have had clean, refined text logos with simpler colors and fonts, Google's logo stayed 2000's-ish until 2015, despite efforts in 2010 and 2013 to "flatten" it. (At least, this is what I believe Google did&mdash; I don't know for sure so don't quote me on this.)

As the homepage has said, the title is simply an identifier for this site; it has no meaning. And so the logo should be too. It should be clean, modern, something easy to recognise but not too difficult to re-create; so, with the old logo in mind, the new logo is simply a symbolic representation with roots back to the nonsensical title but a cleaner feel.

I'll be working on phasing out the old logo for the new one soon. I'll leave it in the site resources if there is a future need, but I don't anticipate it.
