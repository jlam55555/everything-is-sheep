**Update**: This project has been discontinued. Ignore this post.

<strike>This will be an introduction to and how-to guide for [Remeet][1], and will be completed once Remeet has achieved (most of) its major intended features.</strike>

<strike>If you are here, and if you noticed that Remeet took a long time to load, that's because its server "falls asleep" after a period of inactivity and needs to be awoken again. Sorry about that. That should only happen on the first load.</strike>

<strike>Hang tight!</strike>
