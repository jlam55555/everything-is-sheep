<p>It's not the most exciting piece, but it was an interesting prompt. We were asked to finish the "story" of the first page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye"><em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a> (we weren't told it was the first page, but I was informed by a higher student). And here it is: <strong><a href="publications/GettingALife.html">Getting A Life</a></strong>.</p><p>I also regretfully admit to the creation of the monstrosity of an illustration above; it is the result of the second part of the assignment, a self-portrait of the main character given the first page. I thought it would be most appropriate for this post.</p>
