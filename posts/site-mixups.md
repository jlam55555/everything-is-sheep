Many are graphical changes I decided to mix up to help the functionality of the site. Here are some of them:<table id="newUpdateTable"><tr><td><img class="rounded" src="images/posts/newlogo.png" /></td><td>The (arguably) most drastic change is the logo. No longer a smug smiley-face, I drew this new one with an intention to convey a more accurate tone. And I drew it in many layers, so I can disassemble and mix it up like the image above! The reduced logo (for the favicon and the Apple touch-icon for the web-application) is just the calculator in the center. Sorry the pen and the pencil are a little skewed&mdash; I quickly free-handed it on GIMP.</td></tr><tr><td><img class="rounded" src="images/posts/newfont.png" /></td><td>I also have a new font at play for the body text (not the headers). It's a sleek font called "San Francisco" (a punny name for a <em>san</em>s serif-font</em>). It's quite elegant and thin, especially on high-resolution screens.</td></tr><tr><td><img class="rounded" src="images/posts/newScrollbar.png" /></td><td>There's now a dark, thin scrollbar to replace the default one for a cleaner, sleeker look. It replaces only the desktop version though. <strong>Edit:</strong> I realize now that this image is cut off. If you're on the desktop site, you'll see what I mean.</td></tr><tr><td><img class="rounded" src="images/posts/centeredTop.png" /></td><td>All the elements in the sidebar (desktop) or top (mobile) are now centered both horizontally and <em>vertically</em>! It's a minor change, but the off-centeredness bothered me for quite a while.</td></tr><tr><td><img class="rounded" src="images/posts/newCollapsed.png" /></td><td>The most helpful update is the new collapsed view on mobile. No longer showing up with confusing hover pseudo-elements (which doesn't work well with tapping and touchscreens), only the titles show. It's more ideal for a small screen, especially that of a smartphone. This is paired with the smaller "Back to Top" button on mobile as well.</td></tr></table></p>
