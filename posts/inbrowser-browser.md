<p>Introducing another mini-project of mine just for fun: the <a href="extras/Browser"><strong>In-Browser Browser</strong></a>. It's a minimalist tabbed web-browser-like interface inside a tab. I meant to create it as a cleaner interface and simpler to use.</p><p>There are only two controls: <ul><li><strong><kbd>Shift &#8679;</kbd> + <kbd>Enter &#9166;</kbd></strong> Open a new tab.</li><li><strong><kbd>Shift &#8679;</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd></strong> Show all tabs.</li></ul></p><p>You can open as many tabs as you would like <small>(although it is not advisable to open past four or five because of the resource-drain of jQuery animations)</small>, and you may close as many as you would like. A limitation is that my website cannot interact with the site in each "tab," and therefore the URL will not update and it will not show the tab's title; also, if the website has a certain <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options">header</a> set <small>(such as with Google; hence Bing as the default search engine and "New Tab" page)</small>, then it will not work.</p>
