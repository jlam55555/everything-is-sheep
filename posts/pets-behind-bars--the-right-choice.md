We had an interesting first visit to the [Westfield Humane Center][1] animal shelter today, being rejected immediately <small>(our first choice had been adopted a few minutes earlier)</small> and then wasting the rest of our afternoon. It wasn't really my idea (it's Juliet's), but I don't oppose it … after all, [who doesn't like kittens][2]?

But upon our arrival at the little shelter, and seeing the cats at first, it was a bit sad to see them in their tiny cages. They had but two small metal compartments with a little hole separating them, with viewing glasses for the public to ogle at them. <small>(To clarify, I'm not saying this is animal cruelty — I'm just making a comment. The staff members were kind and the place was tidy and clean)</small> They were arranged around a rectangular space where the staff could feed them.

As we left to check out the other shelter, <small>which unfortunately was closed,</small> Juliet asked, *Do you think they let them out?* At first it was a silly question — *Of course they let them out!*, I thought — but is it really? Is it logistically possible to handle each pet and safely (so as to prevent any errors and legal offenses) bring them outside for a single walk? Or do they have to be adopted to enjoy this freedom?

Earlier, when looking on the sites for the [Adopt a Pet <small>.com</small>][3], it just seemed too much to me like shopping for a toy. If we were younger, it would sound like, *Ooh! Let's choose that one! He's cute! Oh, he's soooo furry and cute!* Then what about the older ones? What about the ones that had been abandoned by family, older and unwanted for years, while the kittens leave within days? Looking at the animal shelter, the descriptions from the websites that went along the lines of, *I'll be so happy with a home!* really seemed true.

We judge based on looks and short descriptions. We strive to buy a certain *personality*. Any cat, dog, or bunny is a living thing; and we humans want to *own* them. We *buy* them to give us companionship or excitement; what do they give in return? Do they really enjoy our company as much as we do theirs, or would they rather live wild and free in the wilderness?

Unfortunately, it's human nature, and I don't believe it's anything that can be changed. We like to be the ones in control, and for now, the pets will just have to do as they're told.

<small>Sorry if this post is a bit rough and short — I just wanted to fulfill my promise of posting at least once a day (for now), and it was late when I started. Let's see how long that will last.</small>
