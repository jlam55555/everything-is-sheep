I wrote "floorage" alongside my calculus notes a few days ago, and now I'm struggling to remember what it means. I know only that it was something my classmate R said, and that I wrote it as a trigger to remember what he said.

Too bad.

I found this interesting because I wrote "floorage (and this)" in a list of blog essay ideas, and I don't really remember what I was going to say about floorage.

I think my short term memory is getting worse as a result of the number of new *things* &mdash; events, places, people, ideas &mdash; thrown at me. While last year the challenges were mostly academic, my school workload has decreased while my extracurriculars (and college admissions) have increase manyfold. As always, I can't say I'm yet to a point of stress (I refuse to admit to that condition), but it's getting quite difficult to manage.

My current system for keeping track of homework is writing down unambiguous hints on my papers, which I transfer onto Google Keep for longevity. But even then I lose something here and there. Today it was a sheet of homework for Spanish class. A little blip in the system.

Now for a large digression: my father has entered the room and disowned me during the writing of this post. Long story short, I've lost all respect for him. I think some things are coming to an end.
