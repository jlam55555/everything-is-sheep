Trees are living things. They are organisms that have parts called (as people usually call them) trunks, leaves, branches, and roots.

The trunks of trees have many layers. One, the one for growing, is only one cell thick, which is really weird. The center of the trees is called the heartwood.

Heartwood is dead wood.

There are also many types of trees, including spruce, pine, oak, and more. Fortunately, there are a lot of trees, since we humans need to breathe oxygen in order to survive. Trees provide oxygen.

Unfortunately, trees are being killed. Funny, how one of the things that we need are the things that we keep killing. Trees getting killed has been part of an enormous chain of events, including Global Warming, which has been killing off even more things, including species of stuff which have eventually, or at least *will* eventually affect us.
