<p>I was playing around with Google Chrome themes and extensions recently. Here's what I've come up with in the last day:</p><p><ul><li><a href="downloads/DarkTheme.crx"><strong>Dark</strong> Theme</a>: A minimalist, black and dark-grey theme.</li><li><a href="downloads/ChatExtension.crx"><strong>Chat</strong> Newtab Replacement</a>: I've modified my Chat application to be a Chrome extension. It's also improved in that you cannot post before it has connected with the server.</li><li><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em> <a href="downloads/ChatPopup.crx"><strong>Chat</strong> Popup</a>: Perhaps a more useful version of the newtab extension, this shows a popup once you click the extension button in the top-right of Chrome. Having to sign-in every time is a bit tedious, however.</li></ul></p><p>To install either of these extensions (a theme is a special type of extension), you have to drag and drop the <code style="font-family:courier">.crx</code> file into the <code style="font-family:courier">chrome://extensions</code> page. You can't see my mouse in the screenshot above, but it shows the general idea. Allow it to be added to Chrome.</p><p>If I had five bucks, I would add it to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/">Chrome Web Store</a>, but I don't and I'm too lazy. Therefore, your administrator might block the extensions because they are unofficial (as my school one did).</p><p><small>(And if you can't do the above because you don't have Chrome, <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">get it</a>)!</small></p>
