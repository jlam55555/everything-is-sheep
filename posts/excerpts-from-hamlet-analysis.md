**King Claudius's Wedding Speech: Order of Events**

1. Acknowledge his brother’s death
2. Talk about marriage to his brother’s wife
3. Negotiate with Fortinbras to avoid an attack
4. Talk to Laertes about his future ambitions
5. Talk to Hamlet about his future ambitions

This order of events seems a very clear power play, a quick and utter usurpation of prince Hamlet. First, he addresses the issue of his dead brother, without very sincere sadness, indicating the lack of a person in power. Next, he establishes his right to power to fill in the absence left by his brother by marrying his brother’s wife. The next events (dealing with Fortinbras, Laertes, and Hamlet) consolidate his power by closing his grip against the three young men most likely to take power over the kingdom: subduing Fortinbras (who has the potential to attack the kingdom), asking about Laertes (who is the son of powerful royalty), and asking about Hamlet (who was the presumed heir to the throne). In one “business meeting,” Claudius quickly and effectively seizes and establishes his rule over the kingdom.

**Hamlet’s First Soliloquy: Paraphrasing (ten sentences)**

[1] I want to commit suicide but cannot because my religion dictates against it. [2] I feel that the world has fallen into disarray, with no restrictions placed against corrupt, foul things. [3] It hasn’t even been two months since my father died. [4] He was so great, so loving to my mother— how could the world have come to this? [5] She used to love him so much too. [6] Why do women have to be so weak? [7] My mother cried for a short time, but changed loyalties so quickly, without logical thought, a stupid move. [8] The current king is no uncle to me, and definitely not a father. [9] The relationship between my uncle and my mother is disgusting and is even almost incest— it cannot end well by its nature. [10] I should probably keep my thoughts on this matter quiet.
