<p>I feel so lucky right now. I've been able to experience the first true programming language, Assembly, and feel somewhat good about attempting to understand it in one day.</p><p>I've attempted this once, a few years ago, but simply deemed it too difficult and non-essential. But why would it be to blame when it was the precedent for many other languages today?</p><p>I started with the <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/">TutorialsPoint tutorial</a> on it, and it has been rather helpful.</p><p>I began the tutorial during school today. We had "SpringFest," a school day with two hours dedicated to "fun" hours and activities. For others, this meant playing Frisbee, eating ice cream, playing video games; for me, it meant getting as much homework done as possible to lighten my load for this weekend. Because I really need this Speakout done.</p><p>And finally, it's under five minutes and almost fits all of the content-requirements! It's a wonderful sight to see.</p><p>So, all positive things so far, but I believe it will be difficult squeezing in these two time-consuming activities this weekend. I guess I'll have to hold back on the coding a bit until after the Speakout is done and rehearsed. Oh well.</p><p>And to top that off, I have a "diagnostic" SAT/ACT preparation test tomorrow, the first of my path of standardized test prep.</p><p>Oops, I've gone overtime already! See you tomorrow!</p>
