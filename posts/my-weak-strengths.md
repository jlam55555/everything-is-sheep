<p>Simply put, I had a suboptimal school day today.</p><p>In Wellness, we had a test on CPR, in which we hadn't covered many of the scenarios that were supposed to be "common sense." I've always had a problem with common sense.</p><p>Secondly, we had a test in Chemistry about the <a href="https://www.fcwa.org/water/hardness.htm">hardness of water</a>, <a href="http://blog.wondercide.com/soap-vs-detergent-do-you-know-the-difference/">soap versus detergents</a>, and the periodic table: its discovery, its structure, and some specifics about notable <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-periodic-table-families-and-periods.html">families</a>. According to Dr. Nuzzo, it was the easiest test this quarter; however, considering her tests, it was still daunting.</p><img class="postImageRight quarter" src="http://liveitoutloud.com/image.axd?picture=2014%2F10%2Fthreekindsofpeople.jpg" /><p>The real horrors began with math, the most unlikely story. The problem is that I like math. I like to think of myself as "mathematically fluent." And I don't get many problems wrong. <small>I'm not boasting &mdash; according to the image on the right, I'm right along with the top 1/3 of the world.</small></p><p>The test was coming along well until I began to check my work. I had done <em>three</em> <a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/polydiv2.htm">polynomial division</a> problems incorrectly, and I had almost forgotten the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_remainder_theorem">remainder theorem</a>. With only ten minutes left, I set off correcting my mistakes. The last problem to correct was a simple factoring problem:</p><img style="display: block;margin: 0 auto;" src="http://mathurl.com/h4lgf4o.png" /><p>I had correctly found the zero of 1 and factored it:</p><img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="http://mathurl.com/j6mykdk.png" /><img style="display: block;margin:10px auto auto;" src="http://mathurl.com/z73p4zq.png" /><p>And then, with the almighty <a href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/quadform.htm">quadratic formula</a>, I found the values of x (the zeroes of the function).</p><img style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;max-width:100%" src="http://mathurl.com/zfs7mnk.png" /><p>And then, forgetting that we had to have integer coefficients for factoring, I naively put these two back in the function incorrectly.</p><img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="http://mathurl.com/zkdwzn9.png" /><p>When it should have been like so:</p><img style="display:block;margin:0 auto;" src="http://mathurl.com/zeoso9g.png" /><p>Then, in <a href="https://fcml.wikispaces.com/">math team</a>, a similar  trend followed, and I had three questions that I missed by a small margin that cost me many points. I barely made A team today. Much of this may be attributed to a lack of studying, but there's finals and bowling and sleeping and school and worrying Nuzzo quizzes that I have to be concerned about. And on top of everything, I obtained a cankersore and two papercuts. What a day!</p><p><small>(Sorry for the poor math rendering or the boring-ness of the equations; I'll try to use <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">better math rendering</a> if I attempt to explain math in the future. And sorry that I'm complaining about life &mdash; however, this is <em>the homework life</em>)</small></p>
