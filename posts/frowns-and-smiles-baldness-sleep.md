#### 1. Frowns and smiles

A few years ago, I thought that in a frown, a person's smile goes downwards. Mine didn't. So I thought I was a bit of a happy child, smiling most of the time and not able to frown.

But as I watched my sister's impressive frowns get increasingly common, I realized that I was doing it wrong (or, at least differently from my sister, whose frown I found much more convincing than my own). Her lower lips pushed ups, but the edges of her mouth didn't move.

I realized today that something odd was also happening in my smiles. My top lip is flat, but the bottom is curved. It means one of two things:

a. The top lip moves upwards all at once, or
b. The bottom lip pushes down at the center, again doing all of the work.

In both smiles and frowns, the edges of my lips tighten dramatically.

#### 2. Baldness
I wonder how I'll look bald. Perhaps a good question to consider shortly before St. Baldrick's Day.

#### 3. Sleep
I stumbled upon this interesting quote the other day.

> "Some people dream of success, others stay awake to achieve it." Ziad K. Abdelnour

I think it's a lot better than (and much more conventional than) my currently-submitted yearbook quote, which is the old Facebook mantra from an interview with Mark Zuckerburg: "Move fast and break things." I just don't want people to look back and call me out as a psychopath for this apparently strange quote with perhaps apparently-destructive intent to non-engineers. I hope I'll be able to change it.

Posts like this and [feet][1] truly deserve the `[brain-dump]` tag. I'm thinking about using my newest blog [BABAP][2] (currently in progress) to host random thoughts like this and abstract artwork of mine.
