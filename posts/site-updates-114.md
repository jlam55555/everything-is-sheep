There's been so many changes to the site (version 1.1.0) in the last few days! Here's a brief overview of them.

### External (Visual) Changes

- Added [FontAwesome][1] icons
- Improved title-text descriptions (one for every link)
- Sort posts in post list and search list
- Added social media buttons
- Added random quote generator (see bottom of page!)
- Added search hint
- Revamped sidebar on desktop (much cleaner!)
- Added search bar to sidebar on desktop
- Revamped [index.html][2] page (much more informative!)

### Internal Changes

- Added post tags
- Added searching by post tags
- Added RSS feed
- Cleaned up CSS
- More robust RWD with `.mobile` and `.desktop` CSS classes
- Less data sent to webpages (faster load time)
- Internal dates set to RFC 2822 standard*

<small>(* Because all of the dates were previously only dates,
 all of the times for posts prior to this one will either be set to 12:00AM or 1:00AM, for sorting reasons. Posts after this one should have correct times set.)</small>

That's basically all I had in mind for a working blog. These are the end of the major updates for version 1 of this blog.
