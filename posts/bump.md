<p>Bump.</p><p>That's how they do it, right? Revive a blog post? Spark some interest into a community driven by the present? A present that is always burying the past? The past that is full of virtuous mistakes and the subsequent lessons?</p><p>And that's what I hope to do. Revive this blog. I felt that it was very necessary for me, months ago in Semester one of this year, when I was not doing so well in English class. And then I did well in English class, first quarter of semester two. The problem is, fourth quarter is coming, and I feel that I'm slacking.</p><p>I need practice. Serious practice. And that's where this blog comes into play.</p><p>So welcome back into my life! I really hope no one is reading this right now, because I'm talking to my blog&mdash; an inanimate, digital entity. Oh well. I've done it before, and I'm sure to do it again.</p><p><hr /></p><p>On a side note, I am hoping to revive not only my English language skills, but also those of my secondary, student languages: Spanish (espaÃ±ol) and Chinese (ä¸­æ–‡). I was thinking to include some in each post, at least a relevant sentence or two.</p><p><div class="foreign notranslate">Â¡Hola! Me llamo Jonathan Lam, y estoy escribiendo un blog.
