<p>I was playing around with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">HTML5 <code style="font-family:courier">&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a> these past few days, and this is the most exciting piece I've made so far <small>(besides a game that I just started that's getting exponentially complex the farther I go, so chances are I'm not going to finish it)</small>. I have been using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Canvas Tutorials</a> to learn how to use canvas. (And if you didn't catch on already, canvas is a way to easily create graphics with JavaScript.)</p><p>The program is essentially a text-to-image converter. There are a few features you can do to the text, such as adjust the font size, whether it is bold or italic (or both), the font, the width and height of the canvas, and the colors of the letters. As of now, the colors just repeat in the order they are given, and the text is always centered both vertically and horizontally, so there is a little bit of rigidity. Another cool feature is the lightening of the letters: I initially added this to create the slight gradient from top-left to bottom-right of the words to create hte kind of effect the Google logo has (and you can see it in the above example).</p><img class="postImageLeft half" src="images/posts/wordTheHomeworkLife.png" /><p>As you can see on the left, the gradient effect is cool on dark colors as well. But even cooler of a feature is the conversion directly to a downloadable portable network graphics (PNG) image (with a transparent background, too!). I've never been too involved with graphics, especially programmable ones, and this really excited me. The image on the left was a one downloaded from the site with some modified settings <small>(font size: 110, text: "The Homework Life", brighten by: 255, styles: "bold", font family: "ubuntu", width: 1024, height: 220, colors: ["#000000"])</small>. The idea of the digital image fascinates me: they are stored as zeroes and ones just as text is, and that monotonous binary can turn into beautiful colors and shapes. And now I can make it directly from code!</p><p><em>TheHomeworkLife</em> <strong><a href="extras/Word">Word</a></strong> is easily available on this site with the other projects.</p>
