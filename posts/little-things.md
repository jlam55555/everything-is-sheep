A small shift to a coffee mug. And then a slight upwards push of the spectacles. No practical purpose of either.

Stutters. Sometimes fanatic hand gestures.

Trailing off at the end of sentences about random scientific tangents to the conversation.

Plain mediocrity. Talking into a sea of blank faces, a sea of fish who didn't do their homework for school.

Sentences that aim upwards regardless if they are a question or not.

Poor frustration without any possible outlets. More hopeless eyes.
