<p>For fun and for skill, I've created a <strong><a href="extras/MemoryGame">classic memory game</a></strong>. It uses HTML (the content), JavaScript (the logic) and CSS (the style). The <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (a JavaScript library) helped make it look nice as well. I played around a lot with <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">CSS animations</a> to make the transitions look nice.</p>
