<p>This post is meant to be a test to make sure that I can successfully post this and edit it. <strike>Now, if you notice that a newer post placed under an older one, it's because I edited it &mdash I'll try to mention every edit I make.</strike> <strong>EDIT 1/23/16</strong> from a future edit update, the date <strong>will be preserved</strong> in order to avoid confusion. I will instead mention the date of the edit in the edit.</p><p>Hopefully, this will also prompt other writers <small>(Hint, hint, Juliet!)</small> to be more willing to write without my ultra-administrator-powers to obliterate it if need be. However, there is no true "delete" button on posts, to maintain the flow of the posts and to avoid breaking permalinks. For truly unwanted posts, an edit and a note should do.</p>
