I wanted to rant because 'tis the season for everything! Shopping season, that is. Black Friday season.

Why do people have to make a day for shopping sprees? Why do people have to window shop? I know I would never do it (but then my dad says that nobody cares what I think). There is a great deal of amazing marketing that happens on this day, making people think that the deals make them make the most of their money (which they might be doing, but the companies are making more).

How can you stand *knowing* that you're being tricked into buying things, and then continue to buy gifts, food, digital devices? And for hours at a time?

The modern shopping mall is an amazing exploitation of human nature. My mother and sister went out today for a good number of hours, returning with only a few items bought.

I think a smarter move would be to look at the advertisements in the magazines, and then swoop in to those shops and leave. Window shopping is overrated. Those hours spent walking around are hours lost. If time is money, many window shoppers likely don't even break even with their savings.

It's just a pet peeve of mine. Maybe I'll be on the commercial side of Black Friday shopping one day.
