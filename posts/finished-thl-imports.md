I started [importing THL posts into EiS][1] about a month ago, but I'm finally finished today! I didn't transfer them one-by-one into EiS like I did last time, but I made a little script to transfer over the other 80 posts. (Phew!)

Now that that's complete, I'm thinking about having a numbering system in THL or some other system to make navigation between chronologically-adjacent posts easier.
