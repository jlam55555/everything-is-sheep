I remember even less from this one, so this'll be tiny. Also, from now on, to hide the real people in my life that appear in any of my posts, I'll only use their first initial.

We were about to take a flight to Europe, I believe. I thought it was crazy&mdash; *two vacations to Europe in the same summer? No way!* Not in the positive way, of course. I meant I was behind on summer reading and I wanted to get farther on my coding projects (i.e., this blog). 

My sister and I were led into a room with the other children. It was a sort of informational session that none of us really listened to. Eventually, we were about to board the plane, and they asked if anyone had to use the bathroom. I did, and I went.

The bathroom was in an adjourned room. After I relieved myself, I realized there was another connected to the bathroom. I went out that door, and it just brought us back out to the hallway next to the "meeting" room. Nothing strange about that.

Just at that moment, <span title="look at the above note">N.</span> from my grade walked toward me and told me something. Something important, that I should remember. (I don't remember it now, of course, but I think it was important.) And then I walked back through the bathroom and into the meeting room.

And that's all I can discreetly recall.

I remember that there were at least two other dreams during my sleep, but I can't remember them. One came before this dream and the other after. They're at the tip of my mind, and I remembered them this morning, but I think they're gone forever. Oh well.
