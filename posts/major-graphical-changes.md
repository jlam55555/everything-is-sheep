<p>A new favicon <small>(the icon next to the title in the tab bar)</small>, a new logo <small>(which I made)</small>, a new web-application for iOS &hellip; <em>thehomeworklife</em> has underwent major graphical changes today!</p><img class="postImageRight half" src="http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/650x440xadd-website-to-home-screen-in-safari-on-ipad-with-ios-7.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.E9lhZ45cCO.png" /><p>To activate the web-application, open Safari on your mobile device, and click the "Share" button as you see in the image on the right. Then, scroll right on the bottom row and click on "Add to Home Screen." This should add an app-like icon to your home screen, and it should look like a regular, standalone app when you open it.</p><p>As of now, the mobile version is very buggy, especially with the small screen size of the iPhone, but I'll try to improve it soon. For now, enjoy!</p>
