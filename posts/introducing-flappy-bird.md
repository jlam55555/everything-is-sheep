<p>I was asked by a friend recently if I was able to design a rendition of Mario. He had grand designs for some of the characters. Happy that I had just learned some about <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a>, I quickly obliged, ready to take on the challenge.</p><img class="half postImageRight" src="images/posts/flappyAction.png" /><p>Unfortunately, within minutes I realize how little I knew about Mario. I decided to change it to something simpler. <a href="http://flappybird.io/">Flappy Bird</a>, the minimalistic, pixelated, Nintendo-right-infringing iPhone game that caught the world by storm for a few days, came to mind. It was quickly taken down because <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/flappy-bird-game-deleted-over-nintendo-copyright-creator-receiving-death-threats-1554401">Nintendo had claims to some similar design features</a>. Anyhow, it was popular, I understand the basics, and the framework I had built for Mario so far (i.e., the floor and the background) didn't have to be scrapped.</p><p>Another inspiration of mine was <a href="http://hunterlightman.com/2014/01/30/flappy-block/#more-219">Hunter Lightman</a>, a coder a few years above me at my school. According to his blog, he challenged himself to build a version of Flappy Bird in <em>25 minutes!</em> And he followed through with a game that is deployable on both Android and iOS. That's truly amazing. I don't have the necessary tools to develop for mobile systems, but I thought the idea of designing it with Canvas would be simple enough. It's not a fully-featured app-designer, and it is meant mainly for simple graphics and animations. According to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote class="quote"><span class="quoted">The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene graph.</span><span class="author">Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">"Canvas Element"</a></span></blockquote><p>As you can see, it is often meant for quick scripting, on the fly. There are many other, more popular game-building platforms, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a>. But because it is one of the few (perhaps only?) scriptable-graphics platforms I know, I decided to go along with it.</p><p>Here is the finished product. Along with the basic features of Flappy Bird (namely a "flappy bird" and simple Nintendo-ish pipes to avoid), I added a few extras for fun and for practice. The clouds were done similar to the pipes, a constant stream of randomly-generated figures (that are also randomly spaced). I created hit regions for the buttons (which is not too simple with Canvas because it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Hit_regions_and_accessibility">"does not provide information about any drawn objects"</a>). And I reinforced my knowledge of the basic animations and shapes. Like Hunter Lightman, I probably spent the most time tweaking play-ability factors such as gravity and sizes of objects, but there was also a considerable amount of time spent debugging because of my unfamiliarity. All in all, it took from yesterday morning to tonight, with about three hours coding and a little bit more time thinking. It's just over 500 lines of code. Luckily, I didn't have to focus on too many optimizations, because it is so simple; however, it was still more difficult than I originally had predicted. Overall, however, it was a fun little project and a great first attempt at a real video game.</p><p>Happy flapping with <a href="extras/Flappy"><strong>Flappy</strong></a>!</p>
