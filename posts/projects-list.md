<p>Because of the increasing complexity of the site, I've decided to create a quick little list of my projects in the "About" section of the page. Just click there and you'll see links to all of the projects I've posted to. The <a class="project extrasType" style="float:none">yellow</a> links are for programming webpages, the <a class="project publicationsType" style="float:none">orange</a> links are for publications, and the <a class="project downloadsType" style="float:none">red</a> links are for downloadable content.</p><p>It's a simple, dynamic feature to benefit the organization of the site.</p>
