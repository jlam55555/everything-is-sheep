I was just telling my sister how amazing the last few hours were. I had implemented a few new features on EiS (adding a maximum posts per post list page and associated elements) and debugged and redesigned with it completely planned out in my mind beforehand, and then there was such a straightforward implementation. The changes were written out in my notebook, and the translation to code was so fluid. It's so rare that I thought it was worth pointing out: a perfect balance of novelty and familiarity to produce a most effective period of learning and inventing.

Here are the more specific details about the update.

- Limits of ten posts per page on `/search`, `/post`, and `/search/*` pages
- New URL `page` controls pages (selection of ten posts)
- Added two sections (one at the top and one at the bottom) of page selection dropdown and total page count. Changing it updates URL
- Code blocks background color removed, new break line to fit width
- Blockquotes have added background color and adjusted padding
- On mobile, author profile image is not shown on post metadata to save space
- Post title, author metadata is made smaller, shortened date format is shown, and padding is adjusted for nicest viewing on mobile
- Margins adjusted on author profile pages to prevent overscrolling

Have a merry Christmas weekend!
