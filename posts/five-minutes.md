<p>Five minutes. A speakout. A blog post. Five minutes. What can you really do?</p><p>Well, I can't vent out all my frustration and motivate the public and use the rhetorical devices and practice well a five-minute Sophomore Speakout. I couldn't express the extreme frustration I face, the anger building up with me when I see cheaters get away with it, when I see people finding free answers, when I see people wasting their lives on video games. It's simply too difficult to put into words. And, certainly for me, it's too difficult to put into bodily expression.</p><p>And what of that intense joy I feel when I can learn something? When I discover something new, something so intuitive that eluded my grasp, something that tickles my internal reasoning machine? How can I convince the class that I am not crazy, that I can become a hater of English to one who truly believes that I am inspired by our classroom? How can I give to them the joy that I feel when I pick up just a tiny little trick, a trick that is special to me and no one else?</p><p>And it seems that it simply cannot be done. Not in five minutes. Not in a year. Not ever.</p><p>And yet we go on, writing books and giving speeches, attempting to convey the unconveyable. We try, often to no avail.</p><p>And so I guess the only advice, the best advice to give, is a method to make the feeling <em>theirs</em>. A way to let them experience it for themselves.</p><p>And whoopsies, time's up! Five minutes really isn't enough!</p>
