I think my greatest taboo is the talk on girlfriends. For other people, sure, because it’s gossip. Typical American culture. But when it comes to girls I like, .

There’s mostly the cultural issue. In my family, there is not a single non-Chinese person. In my grade, the Chinese population is very low (I’m the only boy!).

The other part about Chinese culture is their reservedness. It’s as if there’s a studious lack of lust. I can’t be a top student and have a tumultuous relationship status. It’s a lot about reputation. Smart people are supposed to find smart, long-lasting relationships, and high school is too early. If someone asked me on a date or to go to prom, the answer is no. Simple as that. “Hanging out” may be more practical, but still would probably be awkward as heck. So probably not.

That still doesn’t answer the question. And I certainly have had multiple crushes. For being witty. For being “cute.” But it usually fades pretty quickly, and it usually only is on people in my classes. (The latter is called [propinquity][1].) But even for those who I do like, I would still answer “no.” There’s too many reasons why not and not enough reasons why.
