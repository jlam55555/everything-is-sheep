If you were wondering, a ["Hello World"][1] program is often the simplest program in any language, usually to show correct basic syntax and output. Here's that of HTML (for websites):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

		<title>Hello World Program in HTML</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```
