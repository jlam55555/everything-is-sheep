<p>Yes. I started with that title. Thought it is a cool word. Is it a word?</p><p>I took a diagnostic SAT / ACT combo test today at my school. Many of my fellow peers were there, but none seemed nervous as I. I, who worried about scores and my  future. I, who worried about having degraded since my previous test. I, who worried about grades and upholding my high-scoring reputation. So I took the test, and came out, worrying more, worrying about scores and comparisons, worrying about jeering friends, worrying about a disappointed future self when I saw my dismal score. Welp.</p><p>I was meaning to do a lot more today. Learn more from Assembly. Go bowling with my sister. Finish my Sophomore Speakout. I did none of these. Failure for the day? Welp.</p><p>And here I am, writing a totally nonsensical post on my unremarkable blog, using a strange word I do not know for a title and a theme. I feel rather insignificant, misguided, lost writing this blog. Where is this going? Welp.</p><p>And now I am out of ideas. Before time ran out. Welp.</p>
