<p>The title says it all. It's an dialogue inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello">Othello</a> (the play by Shakespeare) and a <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~jdowell/135/Synthesis.html">synthesis paper</a>. Unfortunately, it's also a rough draft, but I'm working on that. And lastly, it's my first literary-work-for-school publication on this site.</p><p>Because it's a synthesis paper, it draws upon multiple sources. Therefore, it's a spoiler if you've read any one of those books. Spoiler alerts for the following: <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies">Lord of the Flies</a></em> by William Golding, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451">Fahrenheit 451</a></em> by Ray Bradbury, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Minnow_Pea">Ella Minnow Pea</a></em> by Mark Dunn, and <em>Othello</em>. If you haven't read them, they're highly recommended thought-provoking novels!</p><p>To get a good sense of it, the thesis <small>(yes, a dialogue can convey a meaning, too!)</small> goes as follows:</p><blockquote class="quote"><span class="quoted">When a mindless person falls prey to haste, it acts as a magnifying vessel to other destructive forces such as jealousy; however, when that selfsame haste be applied to a person who carefully accounts for their own actions and thoughts, then it provides a boosterish rush towards accomplishment.</span><span class="author">Jonathan Lam, thehomeworklife blogger</span></blockquote><p>Right now, it's a bit wordy and not as well-developed in thought as I would like it to be, but it's a start. Now it's time to start freaking about about midterms (this week) again!</p><p>Again, I don't know if this blog will ever be recognized or useful, but for now it's simply a way for myself to reference my own thoughts. Just for now.</p><p>Oops! I've forgot the link. Here it is: <strong><a href="publications/OthelloDialogueSynthesis.html">On the Paradox of Haste</a></strong>. The HTML was autogenerated using the Google Docs Export-As-HTML option. Nice job as always, Google!</p>
