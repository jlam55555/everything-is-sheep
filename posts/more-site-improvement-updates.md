<p>And yet again, there have been improvements to the site. To the sidebar, there has been a color change, and I fixed a few bugs I created with the overall look when working with the web app. The web app is now more functional, but there are a few bugs that I can't seem to fix <small>(one appears to be an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32721596/">iOS 9 bug</a>, so I'm not to blame)</small>. I've even updated the update interface, so the better for me!</p>
