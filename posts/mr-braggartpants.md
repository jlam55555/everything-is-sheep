I'm an introvert. I love to brag. I love compliments. I just don't show it (to others) (in speech) (but sometimes in writing).

So when I helped my sister out earlier today with a programming question, boasting a bit of my coding knowledge (something known as [variable scope][1]), I sung in the shower that I took soon thereafter but thought to myself about my programming greatness. Or that's how it sounds to me now.

Perhaps I'm not the best role model. I'm very competitive and I don't participate in many non-mandated activities that I don't consider myself proficient or quickly-developing in. I call that affection for these activities I do well in "passion." And I don't ask others for their opinion very often. In fact, I've used "I" in every sentence thus far in this post (except for one sentence, in which I've used "me").

I don't find this too evil. After all, I feel better in the long run when I do well, and I might be successful in the future with one of these activities. You never know what I might do. I could code, I could bowl, I could Rubik's cube my way to freedom and riches.

How should I go from here? <small><small>&lt;Haha, I was being rhetorical. *I* don't need *your* opinion.&gt;</small></small>
