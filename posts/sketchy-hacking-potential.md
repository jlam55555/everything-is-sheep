<p>I just searched "thehomeworklife.co.nf" on Google, and I noticed a different site had mentioned it. Curious, I clicked <a href="http://hacker-lab.com/anonymizer/anonym-serf.php?session_new=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5vcGVuLW9wZW4uY29tL2dpdGh1Yi92aWV3L2dpdGh1YjIwMTUtMTItMjUuaHRtbA$$?">it</a>. It was a curious link to many GitHub links, the site name being "Open GitHub" and the URL name with "hacker-lab." Sketchy.</p><p>According to Google, this site was last updated on December 25th, 2015 (last Christmas), and that is very possible considering that this is likely an automated script that scans for new GitHub repositories. I had just uploaded my site up to GitHub around that time, and I am unsure if I had any security vulnerabilities back then. However, I had some problems last week with my database password, and I'm afraid it might be related to this: some curious person may have snooped around a bit on my GitHub before I had made any conscious security measures in order to hack the site. Of course, it might be a false positive; it could just be the stupid self I am that mistakened my password for another one, but there's the <em>slight</em> possibility of attack.</p><p>Anyhow, I thought this would be a good reminder to myself to start ramping up the security measures on this site, in addition to reactive measures such as backup. I'd never really experimented with IT security, and now's a great time to start! I'm sure my friends at <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, <a href="http://www.serverfault.com">Server Fault</a>, and <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/">Information Security</a> would all be glad to help. Take that, <small>(potentially nonexistent?)</small> hackers!</p>
