It's been a little while since I last wrote because of the business with college admissions, school, bowling, cross country, hackathons, Rubik's cubing, Safe Rides, interviewing in Bridgeport for Spanish &hellip; all just everyday business.

Unfortunately, "everyday business" didn't entail writing for Everything is Sheep. My bad. I'll make it up, I promise, there's a lot of ideas in my head for essays. A few lingering site updates that I'd like to carry out as well. Minor updates in comparison to the other things going on in life.

In the meantime, I've been transcribing posts from my old blog, [The Homework Life][1] (THL) to Everything is Sheep! It's a tedious process of transcribing the HTML posts to the more terse (but elegant) Markdown used on this site, not to mention writing in each individual time stamp. It's slow but worth it. I'll be transcribing all 90 posts from THL, tiny or long, to EiS.

The rationale behind this move is that the structure of THL is much less modern than that of this site. It uses a slow PHP-based server and database. EiS is based on a newer Node.js server and text files on a much neater host (thanks Heroku!).

This marks the beginning of the end for THL. I'll leave it up for memory's sake and for the projects hosted on the website, but the entirety of my blogging career will be available on EiS.

You can see posts from THL by searching the [the-homework-life][2] tag. When this post was written, six posts were transcribed here.
