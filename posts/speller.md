<img class="postImageRight" src="http://s11.postimg.org/vxal52udb/Small_Logo.png" /><p>A new little app is up again! This time, it has a useful purpose: assisting Juliet in the seventh-grade spelling bee. It was a fun challenge to create, and it only took me twenty minutes. For now, it's a bit of a rough draft that I might revisit, and the words are limited to her vocabulary.</p><p>In addition, I've also created a little snippet that I'm going to paste into all of these little "web apps" to create a sense of uniformity. It's a small version of the logo, as you can see on the right or in the Speller screenshot. It's also animated and a link!</p><p>See it here at <code><strong><a href="extras/Speller">TheHomeworkLife Speller</a></strong></code>.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong> When you finish, you can print out the results of your study. It will show the number of mistakes (up to six) you make for each word.</p><p><strong>EDIT 2</strong> Many new updates have been added to the most recent version! If you print (<kbd style="font-family:courier">&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;P&gt;</kbd>), then it shows a list of the words you've completed, along with the number of mistakes you've had with them. I've also fixed the bug that counted the number of mistakes wrong (it counted cumulatively), and also added support for multiple-spelling words (in which you can use either spelling). I've also updated it to include all <a href="http://internal.spellingbee.com/files/spellingbee.com/010-2016_School_Spelling_Bee_List_2-pager.pdf">450 words of the spelling bee</a>. Enjoy!</p><p><strong>EDIT 3</strong> I've updated it yet again with a handful of new improvements! There is now a "Hide" text feature that makes the text transparent so that you can not see it written out (for a more authentic spelling-bee-like experience). In addition, problems with scrolling have been fixed, and a "Hint" is provided after six wrong attempts to help you if you really don't know the word or if the pronunciation is incorrect. Now all there's left to fix is the un-accurate speaker and some accents.</p>
