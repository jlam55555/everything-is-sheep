# everything-is-sheep
A blog by Jonathan Lam

This superceded the [The Homework Life][thl] blog, and is superceded by my [current blog][current-blog]. All of the blog posts from THL were [migrated to this blog][migration-cl].

Currently backing up on GitHub. Originally was hosted on Heroku (free plan), currently defunct indefinitely (until I decide to host it again, probably reworking it to be a static webpage).
